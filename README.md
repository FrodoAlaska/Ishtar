# What Is *Ishtar*? 
*Ishtar* is a single-file suite of tools for C++. It has the basic data structures, strings, and some useful algorithms. 
*No need to build it*. Just a single header file that can be copy and pasted into any project. 
*No overhead*. A minimal use of the standard library is present sure but nothing else.
*And readable, too*. A library that you can actually look at without vomiting? No way. 

# What Does *Ishtar* Use? 
*Ishtar* only uses the standard library to do basic things like memory managment and asserts. Here's _exactly_ the standard libraries that *Ishtar* uses
    - cstdlib (for `malloc`, `free`, and `realloc`)
    - cstring (for `memset`)
    - casserts (for `assert`)
 
# What Does *Ishtar* Have?

    -  Linked Lists
    -  Stacks 
    -  Queues 
    -  Dynamic Arrays

# Upcoming Features
